            <p>I'm returning to school after a long absence, which scared the bejeezus out of me at first. However, after years of being an actor, a waiter, a manager and a house manager at various times and often simultaneously, I decided it was time to move forward and learn new things. I love the experience of challenging myself again and finding myself rising to the occasion. <br>This bio feels too short, so I should probably mention here that I love cats. I love dogs too, calm down, I just love cats more.<br>And since Thomas brought up things we achieved at 14, I'll tell you that when I was that age I went to the National Spelling Bee. I won't tell you the year, but I will say that when we went to the White House to meet the President we saw a golden retriever there...
