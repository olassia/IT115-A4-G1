            <h2>Let’s Get Creative With Thanksgiving Dinner!
                By Tom Tourque’, Guest Contributor</h2>
           
          

   <p> Ask most Americans to say the first thing that pops into their head when you say “Thanksgiving”, and most of them will probably answer “turkey”. The two words are as intertwined in our collective psyche as are baseball and hot dogs, Christmas and Santa Claus, and fireworks and the 4th of July.
<br>    
<br>    But why is that?  What caused the turkey’s rise to dominance as the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal? You could say tradition, but it’s a tradition that only goes back so far. There is no mention of turkey in accounts of the Pilgrims’ first feast with the Native Americans, only “wild fowl”, which could just as easily refer to ducks or geese. Name one good reason why, after being relatively carefree most of the year, turkeys have to suddenly worry about being the main course on the fourth Thursday in November?

Let’s be honest: there isn’t one. There are, however, many delightful alternatives you can pursue to make this holiday season the happiest and most relaxing one ever! (link to recipes page?)

So let’s talk turkey...and the reasons you should avoid it at all costs this Thanksgiving.

Shopping...and Safety

     Just imagine how much easier your annual trip to the supermarket to shop for Thanksgiving dinner will be when you no longer have to lug an enormous bird carcass around the store. They can take up anywhere from a quarter to one half of your shopping cart space, and you have a LOT of other items to buy in preparation for the big day. You don’t want to make a second trip to the market during one of the busiest shopping days of the year or try to maneuver a second cart through the throngs of holiday shoppers. And if you think bringing the kids along to help is going to make the experience any less stressful...well, as they say down south, “Bless your heart”.

      But more room in your shopping cart isn’t the only upside to eliminating turkey from your list; just think of your metatarsals and phalanges. Those are just a few of the 26 bones you could break if you ever drop one of those slippery twenty pound butterballs on your foot. Ouch! If you dreaded the supermarket experience before, just wait till you try it on crutches. So much fun!
      
 The Time Crunch

      Even without all the shopping and preparation headaches that go with making a turkey dinner(the brining, the stuffing, etc.), the cooking time alone is prohibitive. Depending on the size of the bird, you’re looking at 3 to 4 hours minimum, because no matter what they tell you it’s never ready until at least the third time you open the oven door and check on it. You told everyone dinner would be at 4:00, now you nervously watch as the natives grow increasingly restless while they fill up on cheese and crackers. If it takes much longer, no one will have room left for the magnificent feast you’ve been slaving over since 5 am. You start weighing the risk of giving everyone food poisoning against getting food on the table NOW.

      However, you can eliminate a lot of the stress and insanity of cooking at Thanksgiving by replacing turkey with a different main dish. Duck, chicken and ham require less prep time and need only one-third to two-thirds the cooking time of turkey. Prime rib may take as long to prepare, but it does make its own gravy. No more lumps! Just put the drippings in a bowl, call it “au jus” and you’re done. Plus, none of these options require basting. Oh god, BASTING! Who thought this up? It’s not enough that it has to cook for 4 hours, every 30 minutes you have to give it a bath as well? This madness must end!

Breaking the Chain

So now that I’ve made my case, hopefully you can see the benefits of moving beyond mindless turkey tradition into the brighter world of new choices. You’ll be happier.

Your family and guests will be happier, not to mention less sleepy. (Tryptophan is not a myth! It’s science.)

Most of all, Thanksgiving will be happier, the joyous and carefree celebration you always knew it could be without the turkey bringing you down.

And this November, when you’re at the dinner table listing what you are thankful for, it’s ok if you say my name.

I won’t mind one bit.
