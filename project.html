<p>Great Start or Ideas from Grammarly on a short Bio! 
<a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-write-bio/"></a>

<br>Your first and last name: Start by writing your name. That wasn’t so hard!
<br>Your company or brand: If you have a consulting firm, a brand you use for your side hustle, or a company you currently work at, list that next.
<br>Your current function: What do you do for work? You can either list your current title or a short, descriptive phrase about your role here.
<br>Your north star: People reading your bio will also want to get a sense of who you are. Listing your overall goal, values, or a statement that describes your ethos will help <br>them get to know you, even in short bios.
<br>Your top three accomplishments: Especially in professional bios, you’ll need a few accomplishments to show off what you’ve done in your career. Choose the top two or three <br>large milestones from your career (no more), and put them next.
<br>Your cute closer (optional): This may not be necessary in a shorter bio for Twitter or Instagram. But for a website or similarly professional bio, you may want to add a <br>sentence describing who you are outside of work.
<br>Your contact info (optional): Depending on the site, you may also want to include an email, contact form, or another easy way for readers to reach you. List this information <br>at the end of your bio.
