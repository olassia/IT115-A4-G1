            <h2>Thanksgiving from the perspective of a turkey</h2>
            <p><It's time to face the facts, humans. You are supposedly famous for your so-called empathy, but in truth you have none. Zip, zero, nada. How else do you explain the mass murder you delight in every year under the painfully ironic name of Thanksgiving? While people are giving thanks, turkeys are giving up everything they hold dear, right down to their giblets. You call it tradition, a celebration of history, but its really a form of genocide--or at the very least, hen-ocide. How would you feel if one month a year you noticed your neighbors disappearing one by one, and nobody will tell you where they've gone? Their friendly, innocent gobble gobbles replaced by fearful shrieks...and then silence. And then the smug, self-satisfied looks on the faces of the people after they've over-indulged during their annual "feast". And the things they say! Have you ever heard someone you love described with the words "Melts in your mouth"? Yeah, I didn't so.
<br>
It seems these words are to be my last. I see my jailers crossing the muddy yard, their grim looks and lack of eye contact telling me everything I need to know. And in case I'm in any way unclear as to their intentions, one of them is carrying an axe...
<br>So consider this my RSVP. It appears I'm available for dinner after all.
