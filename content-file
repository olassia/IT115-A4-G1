Here is an opening draft and a brief outline of where we can go:

    Ask most Americans to say the first thing that pops into their head when you say “Thanksgiving” and most of them will probably answer “turkey”. The two words are as intertwined in our collective psyche as are baseball and hot dogs, Christmas and Santa Claus, and fireworks and the 4th of July.
    
    But why is that?  What caused the turkey’s rise to dominance as the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal? You could say tradition, but it’s a tradition that only goes back so far. There is no mention of turkey in accounts of the Pilgrims’ first feast with the Native Americans, only “wild fowl”, which could just as easily refer to ducks or geese. Name one good reason why, after being relatively carefree most of the year, turkeys have to suddenly worry about being the main course on the fourth Thursday in November?

Let’s be honest: there isn’t one. There are, however, many delightful alternatives you can pursue to make this holiday season the happiest and most relaxing one ever!

So let’s talk turkey...and the reasons you should avoid it at all costs this Thanksgiving.

Some possible topics:
Time it takes to prepare and cook, and the space it takes in the oven
How heavy it is to shop for and dangerous if you drop it on your foot
Vegetarian guests will only eat the side dishes anyway
The kids will only want Mac n Cheese
Too many leftovers...people claim to love them, but do they?
Tryptophan. It’s not a myth! It’s science! Nobody wants to sleep during the big football game
